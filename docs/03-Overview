# Overview

[**Polyanagro**](https://github.com/jrdcasa/polyanagro) is a Python package for analysing and calculating some properties of **polymers** from molecular dynamics simulations performed with the [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/) or [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/) packages.

An analysis with [**Polyanagro**](https://github.com/jrdcasa/polyanagro) usually requires one (or more) trajectory files and a topology file.

The use is made through a series of commands, which are described in the section [04-Commands](./04-commands.md).

The trajectories allowed are:

* XTC from GROMACS and LAMPPS
* DCD from LAMMPS.

The topologies allowed are:

* TPR from GROMACS.
* PDB
* PSF
