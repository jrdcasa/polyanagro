Executable:   /opt/gromacs-2018.3/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /opt/gromacs-2018.3
Working dir:  /home/jramos/PycharmProjects/polyanagro/data/ethanol/RUN-0001

Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'
Replacing old mdp entry 'xtc_grps' by 'compressed-x-grps'

NOTE 1 [file ./NPT_Berendsen.mdp]:
  Setting nstcalcenergy (100) equal to nstenergy (50)


NOTE 2 [file ./NPT_Berendsen.mdp]:
  leapfrog does not yet support Nose-Hoover chains, nhchainlength reset to 1


WARNING 1 [file ./NPT_Berendsen.mdp]:
  Using Berendsen pressure coupling invalidates the true ensemble for the
  thermostat

Setting the LD random seed to 2077681994
Generated 21 of the 21 non-bonded parameter combinations
Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Generated 21 of the 21 1-4 parameter combinations
Excluding 3 bonded neighbours molecule type 'Ethanol'
Excluding 1 bonded neighbours molecule type 'SOL'
Removing all charge groups because cutoff-scheme=Verlet

WARNING 2 [file Ethanol.top, line 134]:
  The bond in molecule-type Ethanol between atoms 4 OG1 and 5 HG1 has an
  estimated oscillational period of 9.0e-03 ps, which is less than 5 times
  the time step of 2.0e-03 ps.
  Maybe you forgot to change the constraints mdp option.

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 5394.00

NOTE 3 [file ./NPT_Berendsen.mdp]:
  You are using a plain Coulomb cut-off, which might produce artifacts.
  You might want to consider using PME electrostatics.

GROMACS reminds you: "You Can Always Go On Ricky Lake" (Offspring)

Analysing residue names:
There are:     1      Other residues
There are:   895      Water residues
Analysing residues not classified as Protein/DNA/RNA/Water and splitting into groups...
Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 450 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.161 nm, buffer size 0.161 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.133 nm, buffer size 0.133 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
This run will generate roughly 8 Mb of data
