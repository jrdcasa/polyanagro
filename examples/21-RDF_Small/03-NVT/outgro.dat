Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'ns_type'
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 407.00

NOTE 1 [file NPT.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.
